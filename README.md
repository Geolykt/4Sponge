CraftIRC Minestom 5
===================

This is still not in a stable-ish format --- usage at your own risk!

---

A fork of the "CraftIRC 4 - Sponge" project but instead of Sponge Minestom support is the goal.
CraftIRC Minestom 5 however has drastic changes compared to version 4 to allow
for easier maintainance and usage on my side of things. As well as a massively reduced amount
of lines of code.
