CraftIRC 4 - Minestom
=====================

A fork of the CraftIRC 4Sponge project so instead of sponge Minestom support is aimed
Due to the nature of how the code is structured I am unable to fix any non-critical
bugs, these include things such as formatting not being performed as expected 
or the configuration being not parsed correctly.

However I will attempt to use an older version of the application which has a different
structure, this would (hopefully) allow me to maintain the code with a better efficency
as well as allowing me to refractor some things without having to resort to refractor the
entire project.
