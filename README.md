CraftIRC - Minestom 5
===================

CraftIRC - Minestom 5 (sometimes referred to MinestomIRC) is the first Minestom-IRC bridge.
It is a direct port of CraftIRC 4 for sponge, however was later drastically changed so now most
of the code is no longer inherited of CraftIRC 4. The changes allow easier maintainance for me
as well as a reduced codebase size and a (in my opinion) better configuration.
